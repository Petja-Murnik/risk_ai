# Risk, Machine Learning and Discrete Geometry

## Quickstart

* `git clone` the repository and `cd` into the root directory
* Adapt the `.env.example` file and save as `.env`
* Create a virtual environment using ```conda```, ```virtualenv``` or ```virtualenvwrapper``` and add the relevant command to your `.env` file (e.g. if your environment is named ```myenv```, add ```conda activate myenv```, ```source myenv/bin/activate``` or ```workon myenv```)
