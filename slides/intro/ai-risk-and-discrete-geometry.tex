  \begin{quotation}
    By improving prediction, optimising operations and resource allocation, and personalising service delivery, the use of artificial intelligence can support \textcolor{red}{socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes} and provide key competitive advantages to companies and the European economy. Such action is especially needed in high-impact sectors, including climate change, environment and health, the public sector, finance, mobility, home affairs and agriculture. However, the same elements and techniques that power the socio-economic benefits of AI can also bring about \textcolor{red}{new risks or negative consequences for individuals or the society}.
